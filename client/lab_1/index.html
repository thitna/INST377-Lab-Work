<h2> Let's Try Some Inline Elements </h2>

<p> Sometimes you want to <en> draw attention to something </en> in a line of text. </p>
<p> Sometimes you want to <strong> strongly emphasize something </strong>in the text. </p>
<p> Sometimes you want to <strong> <en> do both </en> </strongh> .</p>

<h3> Empty Elements </h3>

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br>
Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br>
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample. <hr>

<h2> Images </h2>

<p> Include the four images in the /images folder below</p>
<p> Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accesibility. </p>

<img src="images/onigiri_1.png" alt="A rice ball"> 
<img src="images/onigiri_2.png" alt="Another rice ball">
<img src="image/onigiri_3.png" alt="Third rice ball">
<img src="images/onigiri_4.png" alt="Fourth ball of rice">
